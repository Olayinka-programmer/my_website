        <u><h2>Meaning of Intermarriage:</h2></u>
        <p><h3>Marriage means the coming together of a man and a woman into a sexual union which is accepted by the both the parents of the man and the woman as well as other members of their families.
            <p><h3>Marriage may be inter or intra-ethnic in nature. Inter-ethnic marriage occurs between a man and a woman from different ethnic groups; while intra-ethnic marriage occurs between a man and a woman from the same ethnic group.
               <p><h3>There is no reason why people from different ethnic groups should not marry themselves. This promotes national unity and harmony.</h3></p>
